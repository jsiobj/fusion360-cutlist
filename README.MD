# Cut list script
This is a simple Fusion 360 script for building a "cut list" from a design. It is mainly intended for woodworking

It takes any "leaf" component (that is a component with no sub component) and add it to the cut list with its name, material, thickness, length and width.
As a rule of thumb, thickness is the smallest dimensions, width the greatest, length being the one in between
It display the results in a message box which content could be copy/paste.

# TODO
* Add hierachy management
* improve units management (as of today, using mm for output)
* Add filtering capabilities
